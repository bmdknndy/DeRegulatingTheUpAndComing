# De-Regulating the Up & Coming

This repository contains materials related to my MA thesis in Sociology, completed at Columbia University.

The project examines whether **gentrification—understood as a financialized process driven by expectations of future rent growth—is associated with increased loss of rent-stabilized housing in New York City**. 

Using administrative housing, tax, and demographic data, I analyze changes in the number of rent-stabilized units at the building level during the 2012–2019 period, often described as NYC’s “fifth wave” of gentrification.

This public-facing version of the project is presented as a short research brief, rendered using Quarto and hosted via GitHub Pages.

## Notes

The analysis scripts are included for transparency and reproducibility but are not re-executed as part of the public site build. The brief is intended as an accessible summary of the thesis rather than a full replication archive.
