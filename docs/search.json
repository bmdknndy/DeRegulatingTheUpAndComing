    "text": "Introduction\n\nThis project examines whether gentrification—understood as a financialized process driven by expectations of future rent growth—is associated with greater loss of rent‑stabilized housing in New York City.\n\n\nThe Problem: Housing Affordability in NYC\n\nAround 43% of NYC’s rental housing is regulated, primarily through rent stabilization. While rent regulation remains one of the most accessible affordability tools for New Yorkers, it also creates incentives for deregulation when gaps between regulated and market rents widen.\n\n\nIncentives to Deregulate\n\nPersistent rent gaps between market‑rate and regulated units increase landlord incentives to pursue deregulation or rent increases, particularly during hot market periods.\n\n\nLegal Pathways to Deregulation\n\nPrior to 2019, landlords could deregulate units through vacancy bonuses, high‑rent deregulation, and high‑income deregulation. Post‑2019 reforms closed many—but not all—pathways.\n\n\nResearch Question & Design\nResearch question: Does gentrification lead to greater deregulation of rent‑stabilized units?\nGentrification is operationalized following bunten et al. (2023) using relative changes in income and housing values at the ZIP‑code level, estimated within a time‑heterogeneous DiD framework (Sun & Abraham 2020).\n\n\nFinancialized Gentrification Context\n\nThe analysis focuses on the 2012–2019 period, often described as NYC’s “fifth wave” of gentrification, characterized by intensified financialization and speculative investment.\n\n\nData Sources\nKey sources include HCR rent‑stabilized building lists, NYC DOF tax data, IRS income data, Zillow home values, and Census ACS estimates.\n\n\nResults: Descriptive Patterns\n\nGentrification during this period clustered primarily in north‑central Brooklyn and Queens, with all eligible Manhattan ZIP codes gentrifying.\n\n\nChanges in Stabilized Units Over Time\n\nRent‑stabilized units declined more sharply in gentrifying ZIP codes, with the gap widening substantially after 2012.\n\n\nSpatial Variation in Unit Loss\n\nThe magnitude of stabilized unit loss varies widely across NYC, even among gentrifying areas.\n\n\nInferential Results\n\nGentrification is associated with a statistically significant increase in year‑to‑year loss of rent‑stabilized units. The estimated interaction‑weighted ATT implies roughly a 1.18% higher annual loss rate.\n\n\nInterpreting the Effect Over Time\n\nCompounded over time, these differences imply substantial divergence in stabilized unit counts between gentrifying and non‑gentrifying areas.\n\n\nEvent‑Study Dynamics\n\nThe negative effect on stabilized unit counts intensifies as gentrification progresses.\n\n\nConclusion & Future Directions\nGentrification between 2012–2019 is associated with meaningful losses of rent‑stabilized housing at the building level. Future work should explore smaller geographies, post‑2019 reforms, and informal or illegal pathways of de‑stabilization.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nMethodological Appendix\nView the repo for this project on my GitHub"
